To use Anchore you need the URL, username, and password to access the API and/or the UI.

The Anchore API can be accessed via port {{ .Values.api.service.port }} on the following DNS name from within the cluster:

    {{ include "enterprise.api.fullname" . -}}.{{- .Release.Namespace -}}.svc.cluster.local

The Anchore UI can be accessed via localhost:8080 with kubernetes port-forwarding:

    kubectl port-forward svc/{{- template "enterprise.ui.fullname" . }} 8080:{{- .Values.ui.service.port }}

Get the default admin password using the following command:

    kubectl get secret {{ template "enterprise.fullname" . }} -o jsonpath='{.data.ANCHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD}' | base64 -D

* NOTE: On first startup of Anchore Enterprise, the policy-engine performs a CVE data sync which may take several minutes to complete.
During this time the system status will report 'partially_down' and any images added for analysis will stay in the 'not_analyzed' state.
Once the sync is complete, any queued images will be analyzed and the system status will change to 'all_up'.

Initial setup time can be >120sec for postgresql setup and readiness checks to pass for the services as indicated by pod state.
You can check with:

    kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name={{- template "enterprise.fullname" . -}},app.kubernetes.io/component=api
